# Keerat's Pixel Journal

This portfolio is inspired by the feeling of a personal diary—warm, intimate, and a little whimsical.  

The idea was to create a space where my thoughts, projects, and experiences are shared in a diary-esque way, giving a glimpse into who I am and what I love to do.  

Feel free to explore and flip through the pages—you’ll get to know me a little better with every section.
