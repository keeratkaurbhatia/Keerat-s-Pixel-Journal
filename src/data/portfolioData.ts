  about: `Hey there! I'm Keerat, a first-year Computer Science and AI student at IGDTUW with a minor in AI from IIT Ropar. I'm passionate about building things that matter‚Äîwhether it's exploring Explainable AI in melanoma detection research, developing full-stack web applications, or designing interfaces that feel like a warm hug.

I love diving into creative projects that blend tech with storytelling. From translating Punjabi proverbs with NLP to designing quirky productivity apps with a desi twist, I'm all about making tech more human and accessible.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me writing for my college's literary society, debating at MUN conferences, or doodling in my diary (which inspired this very website!). I believe in learning by doing, staying curious, and adding a sprinkle of whimsy to everything I create.`,
